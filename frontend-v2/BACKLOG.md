## 🗄️ Database Schema
```sql
users (Supabase Auth)
  ↓
leagues (1) → (many) seasons (1) → (many) games → odds
  ↓              ↓                      ↓
league_memberships  picks ←─────────────┘
```

## 📈 Cache Strategy
- **Stale Time**: 5 minutes for all queries
- **Garbage Collection**: 10 minutes for unused data
- **Invalidation**: Smart invalidation on mutations
- **Retry Logic**: 3 retries for 5xx errors, no retry for 4xx
